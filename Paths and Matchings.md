**Symmetric difference**: The symmetric difference of a matching $M$ and an $M$ -augmenting path P is 
$M \Delta E(P) = (M \backslash (M \cap E(P)) \cup (E(P) \backslash M)$

**Berge's Theorem**: A matching $M$ in a graph $G$ is maximum iff {{there is no $M$ augmenting path in $G$}}

**Erdos-Posa Theorem**
?
For any graph $G$, we have:
$\nu(G) \geq min\{\delta(G), \lfloor \frac{|V(G)|}{2} \rfloor \}$
