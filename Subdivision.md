## Definitions / Theorems

**Minor**:A graph $H$ is a minor of a graph $G$ if {{$H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of edge deletions and contractions}}.

**Subdivision**::A subdivision of a graph *G* is any graph obtained from *G* by replacing each edge of *G* by a path of length $\geq 1$.

**Path Vertex**::The internal vertices of a path.

**Branch Vertex**::The set $V(G) \cap V(H)$ where $H$ is a subdivision of $G$.

If {{$G$ is a subdivision of $H$}}, then {{$G$ has $H$ as a minor}}.

A graph is {{cubic}} iff {{it is $3$-regular}}.

**Lemma**: Let $H$ be a cubic graph. If $G$ {{has $H$ as a minor}}, then {{$G$ contains a subdivision of $H$}}.
