**2-Sums**: Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be graphs such that {{$G_1$ and $G_2$ have $\geq 3$ vertices}}, {{$V(G_1) \cap V(G_2) = \{u, v\}$}}, and {{$u,v \in E(G_1) \cap E(G_2)$}}.

**Lemma**: Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be graphs where $G_2$ is $2$-connected. Then
?
any $2$-sum $G_1 \oplus G_2$ contains a subdivision of $G_1$.

**Lemma**: If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are $2$-connected graphs, then {{$G=G_1 \oplus G_2$ is $2$-connected}}.

**Theorem**: Let $G$ be a $2$-connected graph with vertex cut $\{x,y\}$. Then there exists graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ with the following properties: {{$G_1$ and $G_2$ are both $2$-connected}}, {{$V(G_1) \cap V(G_2) = \{x,y\}$}}, {{$xy \in E(G_1) \cap E(G_2)$}}, and {{if $xy \not\in E(G)$, then $G=G_1 \oplus G_2$, else, $G - xy = G_1 \oplus G_2$}}.
