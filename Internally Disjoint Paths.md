**Internally Disjoint Paths**::A set $\{P_1,\dots,P_t \}$ of paths with the same endpoints $x,y \in G$ is internally disjoint if $V(P_i)\cap V(P_j)= \{x,y\}\, \forall i\neq j$. 

**Menger's Theorem**:
?
Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct non-adjacent vertices in a graph $G$. Let $s$ be the minimum size of a vertex cut separating $a$ and $b$ in $G$. Then $G$ contains a set of $s$ ID ($a,b$)-paths.

**Menger-Whitney Theorem**:
?
Let $G$ be a graph with $\geq 2$ vertices. Then $G$ is $k$-connected if and only if for every pair of vertices $a\neq b$, there exists a set of $k$ ID ($a,b$)-paths.
