**Kuratowski's Theorem ($K_2$)**
?
Suppose every $3$-connected graph with no subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph, is planar. Then every 2-connected graph with no subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph, is planar.

**Lemma**: Let $G$ be a {{2-connected planar graph}}. Then, in every planar drawing of $G$, {{every face is bounded by a cycle, and every edge is incident to 2 faces}}.

**Lemma**: Let $G$ be a k-connected graph and suppose $W$ is a {{$k$-vertex cut in $G$}}. Then for each component $C$ of $G-W$ and each vertex $w\in W$, {{there exists an edge in $G$ joining $w$ to $C$}}.

**Contractible Edge**::Let $G$ be a 3-connected graph. An edge $e\in E(G)$ is called contractible if $G/e$ is also 3-connected.

**Contractible Edge Theorem**
?
Every 3-connected graph $G$ with $|V(G)|\geq 5$ has a contractible edge.

**Lemma**: Let $e\in E(G)$ and suppose {{$G/e$ contains a subdivision of $K_5$}}. Then $G$ contains {{a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$}}.

**Kuratowski's Theorem ($K_3$)**
?
Let $G$ be a 3-connected graph that doesn't contain a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$. Then, $G$ is planar.

**Kuratowski's Theorem**
?
A graph $G$ is planar if and only if it doesn't contain a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$.
