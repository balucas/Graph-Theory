There exists a 2-connected graph $G$ and and edge $e=xy$ such that $G\backslash e$ is not 2-connected and $\{x,y\}$ is a vertex cut of $G$. 
?
False

For every graph $G$ and edge $e$, $G/e$ is planar if and only if $G$ is planar.
?
False

For every $k>1$, graph $G$ and vertex $v$, if $G$ is $k$-connected then $G-v$ is $(k-1)$-connected.
?
True

For every graph $G$ and subsets $T\subset S \subseteq V(G)$, if $odd(G-T) > |T|$ then $odd(G-S)> |S|$.
?
False

Every vertex cover of a $k$-connected graph $G$ has size at least $k$.
?
True

Every cut vertex of $G$ has degree at least 2 in every spanning tree of $G$.
?
True

In every bipartite graph $G$ with preference lists: suppose $y$ is the favourite (i.e. most preferred) neighbour of $x$ and $x$ is the favourite neighbour of $y$. Then every stable matching in $G$ contains the edge $xy$.
?
True

For every $k>0$, every $k$-regular graph $G$ and subset $C$ of $V(G)$ with $|C|$ odd, the number $m$ of edges joining $C$ to $V(G)\backslash C$ satisfies $m\equiv k \mod 2$.
? 
True

For every bipartite graph $G$ with preference lists: when the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used with the $X$-vertices making proposals, if a vertex $x$ of $X$ is not saturated by the final stable matching then $x$ makes $d(x)$ proposals.
?
True

For every $k$-connected graph $G$ and vertices $x$ and $y$: the maximum size of a set of internally disjoint paths joining $x$ and $y$ is $k$.
?
False

For every graph $G$ and every function
	$f:V(G)\rightarrow \{1,2,\dots\}$ with $f(v)\leq d(v)$ for each $v$,
the maximum degree
	$\Delta$ of $H(G,f)$ and of $G$ 
satisfy $\Delta(H(G,f))\leq \Delta(G)$.
?
True

For every graph $G$ and every pair of matchings $M$ and $M'$ of the same size in $G$, every component of the graph $H$ with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $M\cup M'$ has the same number of $M$-edges as $M'$-edges.
?
False

For every bipartite graph $G$ with preference lists: when the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used with the $X$-vertices making proposals, if a vertex $y$ in $Y$ receives any proposal then $y$ is saturated by the final stable matching.
?
True

For every pair $W$ and $U$ of vertex cuts of $G$, the union of $U$ and $W$ is a vertex cut of $G$.
?
False

For every bipartite graph $G$ without isolated vertices, $\rho(G) = \alpha(G)$.
