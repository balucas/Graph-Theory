Let $G$ be bipartite graph with preference lists. Call an edge essential if it is in every stable matching. Give an efficient algorithm that will find all essential edges in $G$. You may use known algorithms as subroutines.

For every $d \geq 1$, prove $\nu(T)\geq (n âˆ’ 1)/d$ for every tree $T$ with n vertices and maximum degree $d$.

Prove that if $G$ is bipartite then $H(G, f )$ is bipartite for every function $f:V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, \dots\}$ with $f(v) \leq d(v)$ for each $v$.

Give an example of a graph that has 5 disjoint vertex cuts, each of size 3. Explain your answer.
